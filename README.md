# Asymmetric-File-Encryption-Software (AFES)

## Description
This program is used to encrypt and then decrypt text either entered via the command line
or through a text file. This program uses Asymmetric, symmetric, and Auto-Symetric ways of
creating keys for each instance of encryption to provide options to the user that best
fit their needs when securing their messages. In order to be able to decrypt a message, the
user will need to have matching settings and the same list of ciphers along with the key(s)
used when encrypting. The settings can be downloaded and uploaded so users can easily share.
